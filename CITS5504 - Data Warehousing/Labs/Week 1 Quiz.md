**Question 1:**
 
Atoti is used to generate a OLTP cube. (make sure whether it's OLAP or OLTP cube)
- [ ] True
- [ ] False

- Atoti is not primarily used to generate OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) cubes. Atoti is an open-source data analysis and visualization tool primarily used for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and multidimensional analytics. OLAP cubes are used for analyzing large datasets to provide insights into trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. While Atoti can certainly be used for OLAP purposes, it is not typically used to generate OLTP cubes. OLTP typically refers to systems that manage transaction-oriented applications, while OLAP is more about analyzing and reporting on data.

Atoti is a Data Analytics platform with a best-in-class calculation engine, a visualization suite and a real-time OLAP cube, all rolled into one.


**Question 2:**

Atoti can create multiple what-if scenarios without duplicating your data.
- [x] True
- [ ] False

- Atoti supports creating multiple what-if scenarios without duplicating data. It utilizes an in-memory analytics engine that allows users to create scenarios, manipulate data, and perform analyses without needing to duplicate the underlying dataset. This capability enables users to explore different scenarios and make informed decisions without the overhead of managing multiple copies of the data. Therefore, the statement "Atoti can create multiple what-if scenarios without duplicating your data" is true.


**Question 3:**

PostgreSQL only supports OLAP.
- [ ] True
- [x] False

- PostgreSQL supports both OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) workloads. While PostgreSQL is well-known for its capabilities in OLAP scenarios, thanks to features like table partitioning, indexing, and analytical functions, it is also widely used in OLTP environments.

- OLAP workloads involve complex queries and analytics on large volumes of data, often in a read-heavy environment, while OLTP workloads involve managing transactional data with frequent insertions, updates, and deletions. PostgreSQL is versatile enough to handle both types of workloads effectively, making it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from data warehousing and analytics to web applications and transaction processing systems.

**Question 4:**

What is the primary purpose of data visualization?
- [ ] To make data more complex
- [x] To represent data through common graphics for insight and support in business decision-making
- [ ] To restrict access to data
- [ ] To share raw data without any graphical representation

- The primary purpose of data visualization is to represent data through common graphics, such as charts, graphs, and dashboards, to facilitate understanding, interpretation, and analysis of data. It helps users gain insights, identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, and make informed decisions based on these insights. Data visualization makes complex datasets more accessible and understandable to a wide audience, including non-technical users, thereby supporting business decision-making processes. It is not aimed at making data more complex, restricting access to data, or sharing raw data without graphical representation.

**Question 5: Match** 

Common PostgreSQL commands and statements for querying data from tables
- Query all data from a table -> D.	SELECT * FROM table_name; 
- Query data from specified columns of all rows in a table -> B.	SELECT column_list FROM table;
- Query data from a table with a filter -> C.	SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition;
- Return the number of rows of a table -> A.	SELECT COUNT (*) FROM table_name;


**Question 6:**

Which of the following is considered a fundamental component concept that remains constant in the evolving landscape of technology?	
- [ ] Blockchain and Cryptocurrency		
- [ ] Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality		
- [x] Data, Data sources, Data storage, Data management, Data efficiency		
- [ ] Social Media and Networking

- Data is a fundamental component that remains constant across various technological advancements. Regardless of the specific technology or application, the need to manage, store, analyze, and utilize data efficiently persists. This includes considerations for data sources, storage infrastructure, management practices, and optimizing data efficiency. While technologies like blockchain, virtual reality, augmented reality, social media, and networking may evolve rapidly, the importance of data and its related concepts remains consistent.


**Question 7:**

What was the primary intention behind the development of the "business data warehouse" concepts by Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy in the late 1980s?
- [ ] Entertainment purposes
- [x] Supporting business decision making
- [ ] Scientific research
- [ ] Social networking


**Question 8:**

What happens to the data after the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process in the context of data warehousing?		
- [ ] Data is discarded and not used further		
- [ ] Data becomes unstructured for flexibility		
- [x] Data is loaded into the data warehouse engine and organized for efficient querying and analysis		
- [ ] Data undergoes a transformation process again before loading into the data warehouse

- The purpose of the ETL process is to extract data from various sources, transform it into a consistent format or structure, and then load it into the data warehouse. Once the data has undergone these processes, it is loaded into the data warehouse engine where it is organized and optimized for efficient querying and analysis. This organized data within the data warehouse enables users to perform complex queries, generate reports, and gain insights for decision-making purposes. Therefore, the correct option is that the data is loaded into the data warehouse engine and organized for efficient querying and analysis after the ETL process.

**Question 9:**

Which Docker component is responsible for bundling everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files?
- [ ] Docker Compose.
- [ ] Docker Container.
- [ ] Docker Network.
- [x] Docker Image.

- Docker images serve as the blueprint for Docker containers. They contain all the necessary dependencies and configurations required to run an application. This includes the application code, runtime environment, libraries, environment variables, and any other dependencies needed for the application to function properly. When you run a Docker container, it is instantiated from a Docker image, ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments.


**Question 10:**

What is the function of Docker Volumes?
- [ ] To define and run multi-container Docker applications.
- [x] To persist the storage of Docker containers.
- [ ] The execution of a Docker image, the runtime environment.
- [ ] A platform used for developing, shipping, and running applications.

- Docker volumes provide a way to persist data generated by Docker containers. They allow data to be stored outside the lifecycle of containers, ensuring that data remains available even if the container is stopped, removed, or replaced. Docker volumes are used for scenarios where data persistence is required, such as storing database files, application logs, or configuration files. This ensures that important data is not lost when containers are recreated or scaled.
