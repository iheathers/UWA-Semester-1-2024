The first assessment for CITS5505 is to do some basic research on the history of the web, and particularly the humble hyperlink and present your research in a simple website demonstrating the use of **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. Bootstrap and JQuery may be used, but customised CSS** is required to give your site a distinctive feel.

Hyperlinks are a core feature of the original HTML specification and have powered some of the web’s great innovations, including Wikipedia and Google’s page rank algorithm. Although hyperlinks predate the web, **hypermedia** as the engine of application state was implicit in the original conception of the world wide web and HTML’s href attribute inside the anchor tag enabled for people to interact with information. Recent innovations, such as single page applications, mobile applications and social media are changing the way we use hyperlinks, perhaps undermining hyperlinks and the user autonomy they enable. **Students should research the history of HTML and hyperlinks in the context of the web, identifying key innovations and applications, a basic overview of the architecture of HTTP requests, including the related technologies.**

Your website should consist of three pages or sections:
1. One section should describe the concept of Hyperlinks and provide local examples, describing how they are implemented in the context of both the web-developers and browsers (i.e. as anchor tags and HTTP requests). It should be about 1000 words of content, but interactive examples, including AJAX, and pictures and encouraged.

2. One section should describe the history of hyperlinks, identifying the key technologies and applications and the evolving use of hyperlinks in both presentation and organisation of material. Again, creative use of styles, interaction, media and reactive presentations are encouraged.

3. The final section should give a brief biography of the author, including a picture. It should be presented as a curriculum vitae, and is expected to use advanced HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript to promote yourself, and introduce yourself to the teaching team.

### History of Web - Hyperlink

- title - A brief history of hyperlink
- MAYBE ADD THE RENDERer / playground if possible
- Create a figma/wireframe design once the research is complete
- using iframe/ video tags
- can include ajax to see how the interaction is done with hyperlink
- use a link to your linkedin and github as a demo on final section
